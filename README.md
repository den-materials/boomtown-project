# Boomtown Baby!

Over the weekend, you will be responsible for researching and creating a prototype for a startup at the Boomtown accelerator in Boulder.  You will be working with your squads for both the weekend work and the presentation.

## What Is Boomtown?

> **From their website:** Boomtown strives to be the worldâ€™s most innovative and effective start up accelerator. We own this by having kick ass curriculum, super genius mentors, and a leadership staff that is insanely passionate about what they do. All of this is centered within Boulder, CO, a freakishly awesome place with a higher concentration of startups than anywhere else in the US. Teams will leave after the 12 weeks with their mind blown, butt kicked, ego shattered, and the feeling that they can accomplish anything.

## What Are We Doing?

Monday at 3pm, we will meet the Boomtown folks and get a basic rundown of their space and what they do.  Then we will split up, and each squad will pair up with their respective startups and pitch their research results and the prototype they created over the weekend.

You will be receiving the product pitch and basic app design notes from your startups on a Join.me meeting this afternoon at 3pm. Welcome to your first client project!

## What Should We Have Done by Monday?

You will be meeting with your startups for the majority of our time at Boomtown, so be prepared to talk at length (at least one squad member) on all of your findings and creations.  At a minimum, you should be prepared to show:

- At least 3 competitors/similar products
- At least 3 technologies you recommend to create their product with
- A prototype built on those technologies that addresses the product request

However, you should trust your squad's judgment on anything extra you want to research and/or create.
